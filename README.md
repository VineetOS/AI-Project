Advanced neural networks for specific tasks require
weeks, if not months, of rigorous study by professionals with
extensive subject knowledge.Many scholars have been interested
in neural architecture search (NAS) in recent years because of
its potential to automatically construct efficient neural architec-
tures.Evolutionary algorithms have proven to be the most suc-
cessful derivative-free optimization algorithms of all the search
strategies.However there are many limitations due to the demand
of high computational resource.To create best performing search
model a test accuracy above 75% there need to be a trade-
off between test accuracy and parameter count and constraints
on the CNN architecture that your search function even though
having very large space of all possible neural networks.

## Algorithm
Evolutionary algorithm has the following steps:
1. Random initialisation of some individuals (population)
2. Generating offsprings by combining two parent individuals
3. Mutating the generated offspring
4. Generating the model and finding the fitness accuracy of
the child individuals
5. Adding the children individuals to the main population.
6. Removing the worst performing individuals from the main
population space.
